		<string>1. Position a bar in a rack to about waist height. You can also use a smith machine.\n\n2. Take a wider than shoulder width grip on the bar and position yourself hanging underneath the bar. Your body should be straight with your heels on the ground with your arms fully extended. This will be your starting position.\n\n3. Begin by flexing the elbow, pulling your chest towards the bar. Retract your shoulder blades as you perform the movement.\n\n4. Pause at the top of the motion, and return yourself to the start position.\n\n5. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.\n\n6. Note: The lower that the bar is set, the more parallel to the floor you will be, therefore resulting in a higher difficulty.</string>

	<key>front squats</key>
	<dict>
		<key>howTo</key>
		<string>1. This exercise is best performed inside a squat rack for safety purposes. To begin, first set the bar on a rack that best matches your height. Once the correct height is chosen and the bar is loaded, bring your arms up under the bar while keeping the elbows high and the upper arm slightly above parallel to the floor. Rest the bar on top of the deltoids and cross your arms while grasping the bar for total control.\n\n2. Lift the bar off the rack by first pushing with your legs and at the same time straightening your torso.\n\n3. Step away from the rack and position your legs using a shoulder width medium stance with the toes slightly pointed out. Keep your head up at all times as looking down will get you off balance and also maintain a straight back. This will be your starting position. (Note: For the purposes of this discussion we will use the medium stance described above which targets overall development; however you can choose any of the three stances described in the foot positioning section).\n\n4. Begin to slowly lower the bar by bending the knees as you maintain a straight posture with the head up. Continue down until the angle between the upper leg and the calves becomes slightly less than 90-degrees (which is the point in which the upper legs are below parallel to the floor). Inhale as you perform this portion of the movement. Tip: If you performed the exercise correctly, the front of the knees should make an imaginary straight line with the toes that is perpendicular to the front. If your knees are past that imaginary line (if they are past your toes) then you are placing undue stress on the knee and the exercise has been performed incorrectly.\n\n5. Begin to raise the bar as you exhale by pushing the floor mainly with the middle of your foot as you straighten the legs again and go back to the starting position.\n\n6. Repeat</string>

		<string>1.Preparation - Stand over barbell with balls of feet positioned under bar hip width or slightly wider than hip width apart. Squat down and grip bar with very wide overhand grip. Position shoulders over bar with back arched tightly. Arms are straight with elbows pointed along bar.\n\n2.Execution - Pull bar up off floor by extending hips and knees. As bar reaches knees, back stays arched and maintains same angle to floor as in starting position. When barbell passes knees, vigorously raise shoulders while keeping bar as close to legs as possible. When bar passes upper thighs, allow it to contact thighs. Jump upward extending body. Shrug shoulders and pull barbell upward with arms, allowing elbows to pull up to sides, keeping them over bar as long as possible. Aggressively pull body under bar. Catch bar at arm length while moving into squat position. As soon as barbell is caught on locked out arms in squat position, squat up into standing position with barbell over head.\n\n3.Return - Bend knees slightly and lower barbell to mid-thigh position. Slowly lower bar with taut lower back and trunk close to vertical. The advanced athlete may unload (drop) bar from completed position. This technique may be practiced to reduce stress or fatigue involved in lowering bar as prescribed. Use rubber weightlifting plates on weightlifting platform if this unloading method is used (unless floor demolition is desired).</string>

		<string>1. Preparation - Stand over barbell with balls of feet positioned under bar slightly wider apart than hip width. Squat down and grip bar with overhand grip slightly wider than shoulder width. Position shoulders over bar with back arched tightly. Arms are straight with elbows pointed along bar.\n\n2. Execution (Clean) - Pull bar up off floor by extending hips and knees. As bar reaches knees, vigorously raise shoulders while keeping barbell close to thighs. When barbell passes mid-thigh, allow it to contact thighs. Jump upward extending body. Shrug shoulders and pull barbell upward with arms, allowing elbows to flex out to sides, keeping bar close to body. Aggressively pull body under bar, rotating elbows around bar. Catch bar on shoulders while moving into squat position. Hitting bottom of squat, stand up immediately.\n\n3. Execution (Jerk) - Adjust grip if necessary. Inhale and position chest high with torso tight. Keeping pressure on heels, dip body by bending knees and ankles slightly. Explosively drive upward with legs, driving barbell up off shoulders. Drop body downward and split one foot forward and other backward as fast as possible, while vigorously extending arms over head. The split position places front shin vertical to floor with front foot flat on floor. The rear knee is slightly bent with rear foot positioned on toes. The bar should be positioned directly over ears at arm length with back straight. Push up with both legs. Position feet side by side by bringing front foot back part way and then rear foot forward.\n\n4. Return - Lower barbell to shoulders, then bend knees slightly and lower barbell to mid-thigh position. Slowly lower bar with taut lower back and trunk close to vertical. The advanced athlete may unload (drop) bar from completed position. This technique may be practiced to reduce stress or fatigue involved in lowering bar as prescribed. Use rubber weightlifting plates on weightlifting platform if this unloading method is used (unless floor demolition is desired). Also known as Squat Clean and Jerk.</string>

	<key>kettlebell swings</key>
	<dict>
		<key>howTo</key>
		<string>1. Stand over the kettlebell with feet hip-width apart, chest up, shoulders back and down. The kettlebell should be in line with the middle of your feet. Choose a kettlebell that allows you to swing with perfect technique while still challenging you. Consider starting and practicing with a Ã«bell much lighter than what you will eventually use to work out so that you can practice your form.\n\n2. Squatting down, grip the kettlebell with palms facing you and thumbs wrapped loosely around the handle.\n\n3. Stand tall, still gripping the kettlebell. Keep your arms long and loose while retracting your shoulders blades and engaging your core. Soften the knees, shift your bodyweight into your heels and lower your rear end back and down toward the wall behind you. At this point you should be ready to spring, swing into action.\n\n4. It is go time. Driving through your heel, explode through the hips to send that weight swinging upward from your quads. WeÃ­re aiming for chest height, with the arms extended. Achieving this finish position requires you to snap your hips through, contracting your core while squeezing your cheeks. (Yes, those cheeks!)\n\n5. As the kettlebell begins to descend, let the weight do the work as you ready your body for the next rep. Shift your weight back into your heels while hinging at the hips and loading both the hamstrings and glutes. Receive the weight allowing the kettlebell to ride back between your legs.\n\n6. As it makes the transition from backward to forward, drive through the heel and hips to keep this party going.</string>

		<key>howTo</key>
		<string>1. For this exercise you will need access to a low pulley row machine with a V-bar. Note: The V-bar will enable you to have a neutral grip where the palms of your hands face each other. To get into the starting position, first sit down on the machine and place your feet on the front platform or crossbar provided making sure that your knees are slightly bent and not locked.\n\n2. Lean over as you keep the natural alignment of your back and grab the V-bar handles.\n\n3. With your arms extended pull back until your torso is at a 90-degree angle from your legs. Your back should be slightly arched and your chest should be sticking out. You should be feeling a nice stretch on your lats as you hold the bar in front of you. This is the starting position of the exercise.\n\n4. Keeping the torso stationary, pull the handles back towards your torso while keeping the arms close to it until you touch the abdominals. Breathe out as you perform that movement. At that point you should be squeezing your back muscles hard. Hold that contraction for a second and slowly go back to the original position while breathing in.\n\n5. Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.</string>

	<key>lat pull down</key>
	<dict>
		<key>howTo</key>
		<string>1. Sit down on a pull-down machine with a wide bar attached to the top pulley. Make sure that you adjust the knee pad of the machine to fit your height. These pads will prevent your body from being raised by the resistance attached to the bar.\n\n2. Grab the bar with the palms facing forward using the prescribed grip. Note on grips: For a wide grip, your hands need to be spaced out at a distance wider than shoulder width. For a medium grip, your hands need to be spaced out at a distance equal to your shoulder width and for a close grip at a distance smaller than your shoulder width.\n\n3. As you have both arms extended in front of you holding the bar at the chosen grip width, bring your torso back around 30 degrees or so while creating a curvature on your lower back and sticking your chest out. This is your starting position.\n\n4. As you breathe out, bring the bar down until it touches your upper chest by drawing the shoulders and the upper arms down and back. Tip: Concentrate on squeezing the back muscles once you reach the full contracted position. The upper torso should remain stationary and only the arms should move. The forearms should do no other work except for holding the bar; therefore do not try to pull down the bar using the forearms.\n\n5.After a second at the contracted position squeezing your shoulder blades together, slowly raise the bar back to the starting position when your arms are fully extended and the lats are fully stretched. Inhale during this portion of the movement.\n\n6.Repeat this motion for the prescribed amount of reps.</string>

Standing upright with the torso straight and a very small inclination forward, bring the upper arms close to your body and perpendicular to the floor. The forearms should be pointing up towards the pulley as they hold the bar. This is your starting position.\n\n3. Using the triceps, bring the bar down until it touches the front of your thighs and the arms are fully extended perpendicular to the floor. The upper arms should always remain stationary next to your torso and only the forearms should move. Exhale as you perform this movement.\n\n4. After a second hold at the contracted position, bring the bar slowly up to the starting point. Breathe in as you perform this step.\n\n5. Repeat for the recommended amount of reps.</string>

		<string>1. Using a close grip, lift the EZ bar and hold it with your elbows in as you lie on the bench. Your arms should be perpendicular to the floor. This will be your starting position.\n\n2. Keeping the upper arms stationary, lower the bar by allowing the elbows to flex. Inhale as you perform this portion of the movement. Pause once the bar is directly above the forehead.\n\n3. Lift the bar back to the starting position by extending the elbow and exhaling.\n\n4. Repeat.</string>

	<key>leg extensions</key>
	<dict>
		<key>howTo</key>
		<string>1. For this exercise you will need to use a leg extension machine. First choose your weight and sit on the machine with your legs under the pad (feet pointed forward) and the hands holding the side bars. This will be your starting position. Tip: You will need to adjust the pad so that it falls on top of your lower leg (just above your feet). Also, make sure that your legs form a 90-degree angle between the lower and upper leg. If the angle is less than 90-degrees then that means the knee is over the toes which in turn creates undue stress at the knee joint. If the machine is designed that way, either look for another machine or just make sure that when you start executing the exercise you stop going down once you hit the 90-degree angle.\n\n2. Using your quadriceps, extend your legs to the maximum as you exhale. Ensure that the rest of the body remains stationary on the seat. Pause a second on the contracted position.\n\n3. Slowly lower the weight back to the original position as you inhale, ensuring that you do not go past the 90-degree angle limit.\n\n4. Repeat for the recommended amount of reps.</string>

		<string>1. Adjust the machine lever to fit your height and sit on the machine with your back against the back support pad.\n\n2. Place the back of lower leg on top of padded lever (just a few inches under the calves) and secure the lap pad against your thighs, just above the knees. Then grasp the side handles on the machine as you point your toes straight (or you can also use any of the other two stances) and ensure that the legs are fully straight right in front of you. This will be your starting position.\n\n3. As you exhale, pull the machine lever as far as possible to the back of your thighs by flexing at the knees. Keep your torso stationary at all times. Hold the contracted position for a second.\n\n4. Slowly return to the starting position as you breathe in.\n\n5. Repeat for the recommended amount of reps.</string>

		<key>howTo</key>
		<string>1. Using a leg press machine, sit down on the machine and place your legs on the platform directly in front of you at a medium (shoulder width) foot stance. (Note: For the purposes of this discussion we will use the medium stance described above which targets overall development; however you can choose any of the three stances described in the foot positioning section).\n\n2. Lower the safety bars holding the weighted platform in place and press the platform all the way up until your legs are fully extended in front of you. Tip: Make sure that you do not lock your knees. Your torso and the legs should make a perfect 90-degree angle. This will be your starting position.\n\n3. As you inhale, slowly lower the platform until your upper and lower legs make a 90-degree angle.\n\n4. Pushing mainly with the heels of your feet and using the quadriceps go back to the starting position as you exhale.\n\n5. Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions and ensure to lock the safety pins properly once you are done. You do not want that platform falling on you fully loaded.</string>

		<key>howTo</key>
		<string>1. Stand with your torso upright holding two dumbbells in your hands by your sides (if additional weight is desired, otherwise you can place hands on a wall for balance). Place the ball of the foot on a sturdy and stable wooden board (that is around 2-3 inches tall) while your heels extend off and touch the floor. This will be your starting position.\n\n2. With the toes pointing either straight (to hit all parts equally), inwards (for emphasis on the outer head) or outwards (for emphasis on the inner head), raise the heels off the floor as you exhale by contracting the calves. Hold the top contraction for a second.\n\n3. As you inhale, go back to the starting position by slowly lowering the heels.</string>
